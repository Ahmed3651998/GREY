# Project---GREY

A Python based 2D Game

i created this game in Python 3, using Python's pygame library. This was a semester project, so i had to create the whole game without any aid of a game making software. and in itself, the pygame library is not very good for creating games so a lot had to be manually created from scratch.
the game is simple. there are no levels, only an infinite vertical-scrolling background with a jet as the player. the jet is controlled with mouse movement, and mouse click fires a single bullet. the gun upgrades at a certain point in the game to a continous firing machine gun. the enemies upgrade over time, becoming bigger and harder to kill. and the player jet also upgrades over certain score intervals with a small bonus in HP.

HOW TO PLAY
u need to have python 3 installed on your system and your device resolution must be 1366x768. that is a little inconvinient, but i did not have time to make the resolution dynamic. once the previous requirements are met, simply download the whole code and run the GREY.py file

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
if hopefully i get time to work on this project again, i already have some things i want to change in it. instead of an infinite game, i want to ad bosses at certain score intervals, along with changes with background images giving impression of level changes. apart from that, i want to add powerups, more enemies, player upgrades and i want to improve the enemy movements and firing patterns as well
